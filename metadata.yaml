description: '"The following essay was written several years ago; but I have hitherto
  refrained from publishing it, lest, after having done so, I should find that more
  mature thought had modified the conclusions which the essay sets forth. Judging,
  however, that it is now more than ever improbable that I shall myself be able to
  detect any errors in my reasoning, I feel that it is time to present the latter
  to the contemplation of other minds. It is desirable further to observe, that the
  only reason why I publish this edition anonymously is because I feel very strongly
  that, in matters of the kind with which the present essay deals, opinions and arguments
  should be allowed to produce the exact degree of influence to which as opinions
  and arguments they are entitled: they should be permitted to stand upon their own
  intrinsic merits alone, and quite beyond the shadow of that unfair prejudication
  which cannot but arise so soon as their author''s authority, or absence of authority,
  becomes known. I have endeavoured in the following analysis to fix the precise standing
  of the evidence in favour of the theory of Theism, when the latter is viewed in
  all the flood of light which the progress of modern science--physical and speculative--has
  shed upon it"--Preface.'
